# Copying Commands in Vim

In **Vim**, copying commands are referred to as **yanking** commands. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most common commands and how to use them for copying text.

## Basic Copy (Yank) Commands

1. **Yank the Current Line:**
   - `yy`: Copies (yanks) the entire current line, including the newline character.
   - `Y`: An alternative for `yy` (identical in behavior).

2. **Yank a Single Word:**
   - `yw`: Yanks from the cursor to the end of the current word.
   - `yiw`: Yanks the entire word under the cursor (ignores surrounding whitespace).

3. **Yank a Character:**
   - `yl`: Yanks the character under the cursor.
   - `y2l`: Yanks two characters, starting from the cursor.

4. **Yank Until the End of the Line:**
   - `y$`: Yanks from the cursor to the end of the line.

5. **Yank Until the Beginning of the Line:**
   - `y^`: Yanks from the cursor to the first non-whitespace character of the line.
   - `y0`: Yanks from the cursor to the absolute beginning of the line (including whitespace).

   - `Ctrl-v`: Enter block-wise (visual block) selection.

## Yank Multiple Lines

1. **Number of Lines:**
   - `3yy`: Yanks the current line and the next two lines (3 lines in total).

2. **Range of Lines:**

## Yank a Block of Text

1. **By Paragraph:**
   - `yap`: Yanks the current paragraph, including surrounding blank lines.
   - `yip`: Yanks the inner paragraph (without surrounding blank lines).

2. **By Braces/Parentheses/Quotes:**
   - `yi(` or `yi)`: Yanks inside parentheses.
   - `yi{` or `yi}`: Yanks inside curly braces.
   - `yi'` or `yi"`: Yanks inside single or double quotes.

3. **With Surrounding Characters:**
   - Use `ya` instead of `yi` (e.g., `ya(` yanks the text inside the parentheses, including the parentheses themselves).

## Using Registers for Copying

- By default, yanked text is stored in the unnamed register (`"`).
- You can specify a register explicitly:
  - `"ayw`: Yank the current word into register `a`.
  - `"Ayy`: Append the current line to register `a`.

## Copying to System Clipboard

1. **Clipboard Yank:**
   - Use the `+` register to yank to the system clipboard (if Vim is compiled with clipboard support):
     - `"+yy`: Copies the current line to the system clipboard.
     - `"+y`: Copies the visually selected text to the system clipboard.

2. **Checking Clipboard Support:**
   - Run `vim --version` and look for `+clipboard` in the output.

## Practical Examples

1. **Copy the current line and 4 lines below:**
  ```vim
  5yy
  ```

2. **Yank everything inside curly braces:**
   - Use this command in normal mode:  
     ```
     yi{
     ```

3. **Copy the text from line 10 to line 20:**
   - Use this command in command-line mode:  
     ```
     :10,20y
     ```
